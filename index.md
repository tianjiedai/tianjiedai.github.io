## Intro.
I am in my final year of master’s studies at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. In 2023, I received my bachelor’s degree from SJTU, during which I majored in _EE_ and minored in _Finance_.

Currently, I'm a research intern at Pailitao (Visual Search) of Taobao & Tmall Group. Our team is building an industry-leading visual search and recommendation system, leveraging super-large-scale pre-training on ten billion image-text product pairs. My work focuses on exploring the practical applications of cutting-edge technologies in Pailitao, including representation, relevance, reranking, recommendation and MLLM.
