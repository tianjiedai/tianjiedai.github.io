## Intro.
I am an RI of Visual Search at Alibaba Group, collaborating with a team working on a large-scale visual searching system at Taobao, and also developing general vision technologies for various e-commerce applications. We develop super-large-scale multi-modality learning technologies that can train eﬀiciently on 10-billion image-text product data. This significantly improved the performance of Pailitao, boosting an over four-fold growth in GMV in the past years. Recently, we are exploring the practical applications of cutting-edge technologies, including representation, relevance, reranking, and recommendation, working toward commercializing them for various e-commerce applications. 

I am also in my final half-year of master’s studies at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. In 2023, I received my bachelor’s degree from SJTU, during which I majored in _EE_ and minored in _Finance_.
